# R6-Database

Welcome to the R6-Database organization! Our project aims to create a comprehensive website that catalogs every cosmetic item in the game Rainbow Six Siege. In the future, we plan to expand our database to include detailed information about all weapons, operators, and maps.

## About the Project

R6-Database is a fan-driven initiative designed to provide a centralized hub for all things related to Rainbow Six Siege cosmetics. Our goal is to make it easy for players to find information about their favorite in-game items and to explore new ones they may not yet own.

### Features

- **Detailed Information on Cosmetics**: Browse a vast collection of cosmetics with detailed descriptions and images.
- **Future Expansion**: We plan to include comprehensive data on weapons, operators, and maps.
